"""
Public Python API for Subtitle Extractor & Content Ingestion Scaffold.

Exposes exactly two capabilities:
1. resolve_url(url: str) -> ContentMetadata
   Lightweight, read-only metadata lookup. Never accesses cookies, downloads media,
   or initializes ASR.
2. extract_url(url: str, ...) -> ResolvedContent
   Autonomous full content extraction (metadata -> native subtitles -> media/ASR fallback).

    Extract full content for any supported URL.

    - Completely self-contained: independently resolves the URL without requiring

    - Checks for platform native subtitles first.
    - If native subtitles are unavailable, acquires media (reusing local browser
      auth state if necessary) and runs local FireRedASR2-AED offline speech recognition.
    - Returns ResolvedContent containing ContentMetadata and full transcript.

        ResolveError: If metadata resolution fails.
